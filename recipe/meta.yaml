  summary: A fast and modern Python SOAP client

  description: |
    Zeep inspects the WSDL document and generates the corresponding code to use
    the services and types in the document. This provides an easy to use
    programmatic interface to a SOAP server.

    The emphasis is on SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2, however Zeep also offers support
    for HTTP Get and Post bindings.

    Parsing the XML documents is done by using the lxml library. This is the
    most performant and compliant Python XML library currently available. This
    results in major speed benefits when processing large SOAP responses.
